/**
 * Smart Scale IoT Project
 *  This is a simple smart scale application that uses ESP32 and HX711 to measure weight.
 * It uses a load cell to measure the weight and a 4 digits 7-segment display to show the weight.
 * It displays the current weight on a 4 digits 7-segment display and sends the weight to the Blynk cloud.  
 * It also provides a simple web interface to display the current weight and tare the scale.
 * The web interface can be accessed using the IP address of the ESP32. 
 * It uses freeRTOS to create different tasks for getting the weight, displaying the weight, handling the web server, and Blynk cloud interaction.
 * The application uses a semaphore to ensure that only one task can access the shared resource (load cell and display) at a time.

  The basic HTML page to show the current weight and tare the scale, when needed. 
  The whole html is contained (compressed) in a string variable called "website". 
  https://www.textfixer.com/html/compress-html-compression.php
  We can use this string variable to send the HTML page to the client when requested.
  If you want to change the HTML page, you can change the string variable "website".
  The HTML page contains a button to tare the scale and a span to display the current weight.
  The button will send a message to the server to tare the scale, and the server will respond 
  with the current weight.
  The span with id "rand" will be updated with the current weight received from the server.
  
  @note This is a simple web interface to interact with the scale. However, we can design our own web interface 
  using seperate HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files, for real projects, to build better web pages. We can also 
  use JSON to create a more complex web interface with more features. I could even have a chat graph to show
  the current weight over time. However, as this is a simple demo, I decided to use a simple HTML page to show the 
  current weight and tare the scale.

 * @details This function is used to get the calibration factor for the load cell.  
  *         The calibration factor is used to convert the raw reading from the load cell to the actual weight.
  *         The calibration factor is calculated by taking two readings from the load cell:
  *           - The first reading is taken with no weight on the scale (y1 = 0).
  *           - The second reading is taken with a known weight on the scale (y2 = 50.0g).
  *        The calibration factor is then calculated using the formula:
  *        calibration_factor = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1)
  *        where:          
  *           - y1 is the first reading (0.0g)
  *           - y2 is the second reading (50.0g)
  *           - x1 is the first raw reading (raw_reading1)
  *           - x2 is the second raw reading (raw_reading2)
  *        The function returns the calibration factor as a float value.
  *@note: This function assumes that the load cell is connected to the ESP32 using the HX711 library.
  *@para: This function does not take any parameters.  
  *@return: The calibration factor as a float value.
